## Business Model

## User Experience
### Strategy

### The Problem
From personal experience and research when looking for fitness products, I found that the fitness
product market is oversaturated with companies requesting high costs and profit margins to sell
their products at too high a cost to the consumer for the true value and quality of the product.

### The Solution
My course of action is to continuously source the best fitness brands from all over the world, making
the perfect combination of the highest quality products consumers will love, want and need for
prices they can afford.
My products are from reputable brands that are established and known for their quality and
durability. These products are ones which even the top athletes can vouch for, used daily by the best
there is.
Doing so ensures we create and build a loyal client base, ensuring we collaborate with big brands
and influencers to get The Fitness Lab name known as the go to place for all men’s fitness needs.
Over time we will share stories of the fitness goals and limits our customers have achieved using our
products.
Through creating strong customer and stakeholder relationships we can build our name and grow
our business to further take on bigger brands and create amazing marketing, and a great website
accessible for all in one click.

### Target Audience
Men looking to buy fitness equipment and products - who want the best quality at affordable prices.
These men strive to meet their fitness gaols and needs – from beginners to worldwide athletes. The
Fitness Lab is for men to find products they love so they can use them to keep active, improve health
and wellbeing, while not denting their bank accounts too much.

### Persona
Simon, 38, single. Works from home and doesn’t get enough exercise or steps in
throughout the week. His job becoming remote after the pandemic has led him to
neglect all gym goals as his office was round the corner from his gym and the
motivation to get up and go has left him. Simon wants to find a website that inspires him to use brands he know will make his journey and gym process easy and comfortable at prices that won’t put him off. The Fitness Lab has sizes and sportswear that fit everyone and Simon appreciates comfort over everything.

### Testimony
Averil, 50, mother to Jamin now 17, had both gone through some struggling times when Jamin was
15 as he was overweight and out of breathe easily - unable to feel confident in his skin. This led
Averil to research and buy Jamin fitness clothes of the best quality brands and she states that The
Fitness Lab made the whole process so much easier and left her feeling confident she invested in the
right products to help improve Jamin’s fitness. At a pivotal age Jamin felt like he wasn’t able to join
sports clubs or play sports without stopping due to poor stamina when his peers where all able to.
The Fitness Lab helped ensure Jamin had access to the best brands at prices Averil could afford and
ignited his new found confidence which led him to push himself to improve his fitness from football
with friends, sports clubs at school and even now as a 17 year old fitness influencer for many men to
look up to.


### Marketing Strategy
* The main goal of The Fitness Lab is to create a brand men can truly believe in and
feel secure purchasing their fitness products from. We aim to increase our customer
base from sourcing only top quality brands even the best athletes can vouch for. We
will increase our sales by being the number one company customers and
stakeholders go to for the best fitness brands at prices customers can afford.

* This is where The Fitness Lab Website comes in. Having a strong brand and website
to start our company means we can build loyal consumer relationships using our
easy to use website to show customers how smooth and secure The Fitness Lab
experience is. This creates a positive, growing online presence bringing with it
everyday customers as well as highly respected athletes, reaching audiences across
the globe as our popularity increases in line with the increases of our market scale
and scope.

* With a well-functioning website and a social media page as our beginning point, we
can begin to reach further audiences and men on social media – branching out with
advertisement in gyms, on sports programmes and at live sporting events. This will
help us to create a profit used to continuously grow our range of products and the
brands we partner with while also evolving our SEO – building a whole host of
features in the future such as a fitness gym website with plans tailored to suit
individual fitness gaols using only our products, educational resources and stories of
men who have worked with The Fitness Lab and used our company to better their
health and wellbeing and continuous improvements to grow as a whole, becoming
the perfect formula for your fitness needs.

### Data Model
This project used Object Oriented programming, utilising model classes to define data. PostgreSQL and ElephantSQL were used to create a relational database of objects. Seven different models were created covering the product catalogue and the journey of the customer from browsing to checkout. These include Item, Brand, Category, Review, Newsletter, Order, OrderLineItem, UserProfile and User. Data fields were defined for each parameter and foreign key fields were used to reference objects in different tables

![SQL Data Model](media/sql-data-model.png)


### Wireframes
This site uses a familiar web design pattern to provide a seamless and instinctual experience to the users. The logo was placed in the top left corner with the navigation menu and search bar placed centrally on the top of the screen, alongside personal information and basket links to the right. The pages have large titles, clearly indicating the subject of the proceeding content, and the body of the page is layed out to contain a large amount of information in a small space without being overcrowded or too busy. It accentuates the key content - the products - by making the focus of product and product detail pages the item images themselves. The footer also clearly indicates how users can find out more through Facebook and reading the company's privacy policy. Wireframes were constructed for each page using Balsamiq and are shown below.

#### Checkout Page

### Agile Approach
This project was implemented using an Agile approach to take advantage of the iterative and incremental development.

A key advantage of this approach was the iterative and incremental development, which created a highly adaptable and efficient work schedule. Tasks were completed in stages to fulfil user stories, which incrementally improved the functionality of the website. The project was split into 5 day iterations, to review progress and adjust the work schedule accordingly.

GitHub Projects was used to organise the project tasks and timeline. A kanban board was used to move user stories across To Do, In Progress and Done columns according to their status.

## Future Enhancements
Various additional features would bring a greater user experience to the website:
* Allow only users who have bought items to give items reviews and ratings.
* Allow users to interactively add a rating to the products.
* Add a sale and deals section and have the first products a customer see be items on sale.
* Add a wishlist so users can add products which they would like to buy in the future to.
* Add a related products section where users can see similar products to the one they are currently viewing.





## Marketing

A Facebook page was created to help generate business for the site and to raise awareness of the brand.

Using organic social media will be a key way in developing the business. The aim is to have a presence on other social media sites such as Twitter, Instagram and LinkedIn as these are the main social media channels young adult men would use.

Using paid social media will also be a key target as focussing on advertising to users who have already visited the site will increase revenue. This can cost a significant amount but, when used correctly and intentionally, in the long term it will produce good results.

Email marketing will be a key part in increasing website traffic where The newsletter sign-up is the first stage of retrieving emails.

Using paid adverts such as Google ads will not initially be a priority due to the cost but will be in the future.

  * Click on 'Policy generator' under the Bucket Policy Tab and add in the ARN + `/*` (which looks similar to `arn:aws:s3:::your-bucket-name/*`) to the generated policies 'Resource' section. Then add the generated policy to the 'Bucket Policy Editor'.
  * Now navigate to the AWS app 'IAM' and create a 'Group' making sure you add in your existing S3 Bucket details.
  * Once you have done this, create a 'New Policy' and 'New User' and add them to your 'Group'.
  * After this, go back to the config variables in the Heroku app and delete the 'DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC' variable.
  * Deploy again to heroku by entering `git push heroku main` in your terminal and you should be fully set up.
